Dynamic Programming - 
    Properties :
    optimal subtrcuture and overlapping subproblem

optimal subtrcuture : 
    if we can write recurrence relation, then a problem is said to have optimal subtrcuture.

overlapping subproblem :
    if our subproblems repeat, then a problem is said to have overlapping subproblem

Example : fibonacci series
        we will store our repeating answers somewhere to save our time (this property is called Dynamic Programming)

Ways to handle overlapping subproblem :
    Memoization      and        Tabulation

Memoization : 
        A lookup table is maintained and checked before computataion of any state.
        Recursion is involved.

Tabulation : 
        Solution is build from Bottom to top.
        It is an iterative process.
